## Wide and Deep price prediction model (Using Keras)

This model predicts the prices of a smartphone based on the description. 

The training data is a dataset of about 2000 scraped smartphone descriptions from a famous second hand website. (At the time that was the all data available and this was set to be an experiment with the current available data) 
***

The code in while the model is build and saved as a h5 file is at the "Wide and Deep Model for Smart Phones.ipynb" file,


The "prediction file.ipynb" is the piece in which we use the saved h5 model in order to predict the prices from handwritten inputs.
